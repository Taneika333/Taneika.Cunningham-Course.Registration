Limitation:
A pleasant day to you, My program was created in google-collab since I had no space on my device to accommodate a new app. Running my program in another browser may be a limitation to its functionality. 
Purpose:
This is a menu-driven python program application that,
1. Register students and manage their details. 
2. Add courses with unique identifiers and fees. 
3. Allow students to enroll in courses while tracking their balance. 
4. Accept partial payments (minimum 40% of the balance) and update the outstanding balance. 5. Provide administrators with tools to view enrolled students, course details, and individual student balances. 


Note that a student has to be registered and courses have to be added in the system before you can enroll them to a course and check the other options. The program uses error handling to ensure the system is robust and user-friendly. 


How to run it: 
With the use of a while loop, the user will be able to select an option from 1-9 and input the necessary information to fulfil their objective.
